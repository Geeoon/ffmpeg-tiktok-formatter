# FFmpeg TikTok Formatter
This project takes a widescreen or vertical clip and adds another clip so that it can be uploaded to TikTok, or any short-form content site, in a format that helps it retain attention longer.

This porject is similar to the [TikTokClipReup](github.com/Geeoon/TikTokClipReup) project, but uses FFmpeg directly through the ffmpy Python wrapper.
